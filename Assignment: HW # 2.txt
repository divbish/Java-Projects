There are well defined grammatical rules for a programming language. These rules are required to be followed very strictly in a program, and the compiler detects wherever they are violated. These mistakes in the grammar of a program are called Syntax errors.

A logic  is required to design an algorithm or a solution to a given problem. When there is a mistake in the algorithm it is known as Logic error. Despite of no syntax error the program then gives incorrect output.
