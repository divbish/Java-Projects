Question#18
In the first iteration product will be multiplied to the zero and that will make the subsequent iteration useless where the numbers from 1 - 20 will multiplied to zero and resulting in zero as output.
correction has to be made as below -
for (int i = 1; i<=max; i++)

Question#19 
In this program user wants to calculates the sum and product of first 20 natural numbers.The mistake is leaving out the statement to calculate product out of scope of the for loop.The correct statement is below-

for (int i = 1; i<=max; i++)
{
	sum = sum + i;
	product = product * i
 }
