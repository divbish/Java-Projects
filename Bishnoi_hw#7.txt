Question#1
output-
0
1
2
3
4
count after loop=5


Question#2 
Ans- yes,because When a while loop boolean expression is false, the loop body is not executed but a a do-while loop is always executed at least once. 

Question#5
Ans - This is an infinite loop because count is not increasing which is required to break out of while loop.

Question#6
public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		 Scanner keyboard = new Scanner (System.in);
		 int population=0;
		 while(population <=0)
		 {
			 System.out.println("The population must be positive");
		     System.out.println("Enter the population of the city");
			 population = keyboard.nextInt();
		 }
		 System.out.print("Population is "+population);
	 }

Output:
The population must be positive
Enter the population of the city
-1
The population must be positive
Enter the population of the city
0
The population must be positive
Enter the population of the city
2
Population is 2

Question#14
public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		 int count=0;
		 while(count<4)
		 {
			 System.out.println("One more time");
			 count++;
		 }
	 }

 output-
One more time
One more time
One more time
One more time

Question#15
public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		 int result=1,i;
		 for(i=0;i<5;i++)
			result = result * 2;
		 System.out.println("result is" + result);
	}

 output-
result is 32








Question#16

public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		 Scanner keyboard = new Scanner (System.in);
         double sum=0,average=0;
         System.out.print("Enter a decimel number with a sentinel value at the end");
         double number=keyboard.nextDouble() ;
         int count=0;
		 while (number>0.9)
			{
			 sum = sum +number;
			 System.out.print("Enter a decimel number with a sentinel value at the end");
	         number=keyboard.nextDouble();
			 count++;
			} 
		 if (count>0){
		 average = sum/count;
		 System.out.println("result is " + average);
		 }
		 else
			 System.out.println("nothing to average");
	}

Output:
Enter a decimel number with a sentinel value at the end1.002
Enter a decimel number with a sentinel value at the end3.000005
Enter a decimel number with a sentinel value at the end2.005
Enter a decimel number with a sentinel value at the end6.0004
Enter a decimel number with a sentinel value at the end0.8
result is 3.0018512499999996

Question#21
The code is adding penalty to balance and is subtracting deposit from balance which is wrong. The statements should be as below:
balance = balance - penalty;
balance = balance + deposit;

Another problem will happen when penalty is greater than deposit, then the balance becomes less that 0 and loop runs infinitely.

Question#22
public static void main(String[] args)
 {
		int sum=0, n;
		System.out.println("sum before loop is "+sum);
		for(n=1;n<10;n++){
			sum=sum+n;
			System.out.println("n is "+n+" sum so far is "+sum);
		}
		System.out.println("1+2+...+9+10=="+sum);
	}

Output:
sum before loop is0
n is 1 sum so far is 1
n is 2 sum so far is 3
n is 3 sum so far is 6
n is 4 sum so far is 10
n is 5 sum so far is 15
n is 6 sum so far is 21
n is 7 sum so far is 28
n is 8 sum so far is 36
n is 9 sum so far is 45
1+2+...+9+10==45















Question#23

The condition in the for loop should be checked to be equal to 10.

Here is the correct code:
public static void main(String[] args) 
{
		int sum=0, n;
		for(n=1;n<=10;n++){
			sum=sum+n;
		}
		System.out.println("1+2+...+9+10=="+sum);
	}
