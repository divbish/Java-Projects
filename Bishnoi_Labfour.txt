How does a nested conditional statement work?
Ans- The outermost condition is checked first and then the program enters into the scope of the condition if it is true. Otherwise the control moves to the first else statement,looks for any nested if condition.If that condition is true the control statement moves into that “if” scope. So, all the nested if conditions are checked which are in the following else conditions. If none of the conditions are true then the control executes the falls through else. 

2. Is aligning of the braces important for the compiler or the reader?
Ans- Java defines scope by opening and ending braces, so all opening braces must have their ending braces. But in  java, indentation is for viewing purposes but makes no difference to the compiler.

3 Why is the statement needed else fee = 0; in Lab 4?
Test the program without it. You may just place a comment before the line and run it
again. What happens? e.g. // else fee = 0;
Ans- “else fee = 0” is a falls through else which will be executed when none of the above conditions were true. In this case the variable fee will never be initialized and so the compiler detects an error saying “variable fee might not had been initialized”.

4. What is an accumulating statement?
Ans- An accumulating statement is one which does two operations, update, and assignment of the same variable. 
example - count = count + 1. Here count is added to 1 and then assigned to itself.

5. Why must an accumulator be initialized to zero? When in the program is the accumulator initialized to zero?
Ans- In the accumulating statement the accumulator is used to calculated the new value for accumulator, so if the value is not initialized, its value will not be determined in the accumulation operation.
The value of the accumulator has to be initialized before the accumulation statement.

6. How does a for loop work?
Ans- for(int i=0; i< 10; i++){//do something}
The for loop consists of three parts, initialization of the counter, conditional statement to check the counter’s value, and the part to change the counter.
First the counter is initialized, then it is checked in the conditional statement, then statements in the scope of for loop are executed, then the counter is incremented, now again the counter is checked in conditional statement. After this the loop continues in the same fashion till the conditional statement invalidates.

7. What is the difference between a loop and a conditional statement?
Ans - A loop statement repeats an action again and again until some stopping condition is met.But in conditional statement, a condition is checked once and its result decide on either if or else block will be executed. 

8. How are strings compared in Java?
Ans - “equals” method of String class is used to compare values of two strings.
Example - String s1, s2; s1.equals(s2);

9. How are primitives compared in Java?
Ans - Primitives are compared by using “==“ operator in java.
Example: int i1, i2; i1==i2;

10. What happens if you don’t place a prompt statement before a keyboard.next Double( ) statement? Will the program compile? Will the program run?
Ans - The user will not know what he/she is supposed to do.
The program will compile, and run as well. But the user of the program should know when to enter what type of value as he/she would not be prompted.
