Question 27-

package hw4;

public class Question27 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
	
		System.out.println("Once upon a time,");
		System.out.println("there were three little programmers.");
		System.out.println("Once upon a time,\nthere were three little programmers.");
		System.out.print("Once upon a time,\nthere were three little programmers.");
		
	}

}

Output-

Once upon a time,
there were three little programmers.
Once upon a time,
there were three little programmers.
Once upon a time,
there were three little programmers.


Question 28-

Ans- In System.out.println it prints a new line after printing the text which is with in its quotes whereas System.out.print does not prints the new line and the output of subsequent print statement prints on the same line.
System.out.println(“hello”);
The above statement is equivalent to:
System.out.print(“hello”);
System.out.print(“\n”);




Question 29-


package hw4;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Question29 {
	
	public static void main(String[]args) {
		Scanner keyboard = new Scanner (System.in);
		int number1,number2;
		System.out.println("Enter two numbers with space in between");
		number1 = keyboard.nextInt();
		number2 = keyboard.nextInt();
		System.out.println("number1 is " + number1+"  number2 is "+number2);
		
	}
}

output-

Enter two numbers with space in between
1 2
number1 is 1  number2 is 2

Question 6-

This exercise helped me to identify how much eclipse has been helping me to write code correctly. I practiced on word before writing in eclipse.
The problems that i faced were:
 1. writing correct syntax to define a class
 2.  defining main function arguments
 3. and i forgot to make “s” caps in “System.out.println”


Below is the code that i rewrote in eclipse to verify my output:



package question6;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Question6 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		Scanner keyboard = new Scanner (System.in);
		System.out.println("Enter a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit");
		int fah;
		double cel;
		fah = keyboard.nextInt();//question has asked us to accept int only, decimal input will throw error
		cel = 5 * ((double)fah - 32)/9;// type casting fah from int to double to make sure decimal is preserved in output
		System.out.printf("%d degrees Fahrenheit is %2.1f degree Celsius", fah,cel);
		cel = 5.0 * (fah - 32)/9;//this also works, because we changed 5 from int to double
		System.out.printf("\n%2d degrees Fahrenheit is %2.1f degree Celsius", fah,cel);
		
	}

}

Output:

Enter a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit
72
72 degrees Fahrenheit is 22.2 degree Celsius
72 degrees Fahrenheit is 22.2 degree Celsius


Enter a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit
72.2
