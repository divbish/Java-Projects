2.Give an example when the “then part” of the conditional and the “else part “ are both executed?
Ans- Either “then part” or “else part “ of the condition never gets executed.both can not be executed at the time in the same run of the program.

3.State the syntax for the "if then else" statement.
Ans-  if (Boolean_Expression) Statement_1
         else 
             Statement_2

 4.What does it mean that there is no "fall through" else? Is there a "fall through" else in this program?

Ans-It is the last else statement which is executed when none of the conditions above it were satisfied.

-yes there is “ fall through “ else in this program which is below.The discounted price gets the value of regular price if there is non of the conditions  above were true.
else
	discountedPrice = regularPrice;

5.What are the six relational operators?

6.How do you get money amounts printed in dollar and cents?
Ans- We can use format method of DecimalFormat class which accepts a double value for which the formatting has to be done. In this case we need money to display two digits of fraction part of money which are cents, so we can call setMaximumFractionDigits and setMinimumFractionDigits methods of DecimalFormat and set their value as 2.

7.Is the value discountedPrice saved in memory with only two decimal places?
Ans - No, discountedPrice is of double type and it can have any number of decimal places. We are using format method of DecimalFormat class to change the price in display only.
