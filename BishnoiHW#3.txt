Question 6. 

Ans- When these lines of code are written within scope of main function  are executed and generates the following output:

My age is
20

Question 8.
Ans- 
package lab1Package;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Myage {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		int age;
		Scanner keyboard = new Scanner (System.in);
		System.out.println("Enter your age");
           age = keyboard.nextInt ( );
		System.out.println ("Your age is");
		System.out.println (age);
		System.out.println("Enter your brother's age");
		age = keyboard.nextInt ( );
		System.out.println ("Your brother's age is");
		System.out.println (age);
	}

}

OUTPUT:
Enter your age
25
Your age is
25
Enter your brother's age
20
Your brother's age is
20

Question 9.

package lab1Package;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class InterestCalculator {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
        double interest,balance,rate; 
        Scanner keyboard = new Scanner (System.in);
        System.out.println ("enter balance");
        balance = keyboard.nextDouble();
        System.out.println ("enter rate");
        rate = keyboard.nextDouble();
        interest = balance * rate;
        System.out.println ("The value of interest is " + interest);
        balance = 200;
        rate = 50;
        interest = balance * rate;
        System.out.println ("The value of interest is " + interest);
	}

}

OUTPUT:



enter balance
54
enter rate
7
The value of interest is 378.0
The value of interest is 10000.0






Question 10.

Ans.

package labTwoPackage;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Assignment {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		int count;
		Scanner keyboard = new Scanner (System.in);
		System.out.println("enter count");
		count = keyboard.nextInt();
		count = count + 3;
		System.out.println("The value of count is " + count);
		count = 100;
		count = count + 3;
		System.out.println("The value of count is " + count);
		

	}

}

OUTPUT:

enter count
20
The value of count is 23
The value of count is 103











Question 11.

package labTwoPackage;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Assignment {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		char a, b;
		a = 'b';
		System.out.println(a);
		b = 'c';
		System.out.println(b);
		a = b;
		System.out.println(a);
	}
}

OUTPUT:

b
c
c

Question 13.

quotient = 2
remainder = 1







Question 14.

package labTwoPackage;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Assignment {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		double result = (1 / 2) * 2;
		System.out.println("(1 / 2) * 2 equals " + result);
		result = (1 / 2.0) * 2;
		System.out.println("(1 / 2.0) * 2 is equal to " + result);
		result = (1.0 / 2) * 2;
		System.out.println("(1.0 / 2) * 2 is equal to " + result);
	}
}

OUTPUT:

(1 / 2) * 2 equals 0.0
(1 / 2.0) * 2 is equal to 1.0
(1.0 / 2) * 2 is equal to 1.0

Question 15.
 
7 * 3 = 21 
21% 3 = 0
0 - 4 - 6 = - 10

result is -10

Note: % is use to calculate remainder.
